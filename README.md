# MCPlayer - The Monstercat Player


MCPlayer is an unofficial Monstercat player designed to enhance your music listening experience with Monstercat on Android devices. It uses the Monstercat API to provide access to the whole Monstercat music library.

> Please note that with addition of Captcha to the login process on the side of Monstercat, we can no longer validate users and check for Gold subscription. App is now account-less, which means that every user has access to the whole library. Please, sign up on the [official website](https://monsercat.com) and get Gold subscription before using the app. For Monstercat representatives: we are sorry, this is the only way. If you want us to take the app down, we'll have to comply and we'll do so eagerly. Please let us know at support@puzzak.page.

### ~~Authorisation and registration~~

Before v0.0.15 users were able to register and login through the app. In 2024, Monstercat added Captcha firstly to login and then to registration flows, so in v0.0.15 we've had to remove registration from the app and in v0.0.16 registration and everything user-related was gone. See [changelog](changelog.md) for more info.

### ~~Account controls~~

Before these changes, users were able to change email, password and other account information via the app. Playlist creation and usage was also possible, you could use your library in it's fullest. Now you can't access your playlists.

Following features were removed:
  - ~~Register a new account within the app.~~
  - ~~Sign in with 2FA support~~.
  - ~~View and update account information~~.
  - ~~Change email address and password.~~
  - ~~Create, edit, share, and delete playlists.~~
  - ~~View detailed album information and songs list.~~
  - ~~Share playlists and releases.~~

### Optimised home page

In-app home page is just like the original from the [official player](https://player.monstercat.app), just better optimised for mobile devices and with cool design.

### Powerful search
You can search through whole Monstercat library using original filters and genre selectors, just much easier. In tablet view you can use two-pane UI to preview your search and search easier.

### System Integration

The player is integrated into system just like any normal player would, so voice commands and external controls are supported, it utilizes default system player in control panel. You can also enable link handling in system settings for the app to make it open albums and playlists in the app.

### Wide-screen support

No matter what device you are using this app on, tablets and Chromebooks have dedicated full-screen UI for convenience.

### Design

  Special thanks to [DarkPlayer](https://github.com/DarkPlayerr) for the outstanding design work on MCPlayer. Without him, this app would be the default MD3 player with no soul. Go follow him and let him know if you like the design!
